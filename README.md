# TwilioQuestJavascriptSolutions
LEAKED PROGRAMS FROM TOP-SECRET JAVASCRIPT LAB

I don't think they'll see me, but I can't be too sure, so I'll keep to the point.
Look, if you're shopping around for these solutions, you're probably as bad as me at coding.
The Legacy System sabotaged the Lab and if you don't get it fixed, they're all as good as gone.

Just keep The Cloud safe. I'll leave these backup scripts in case you joined, too.

Good luck, Operator.
